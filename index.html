<h1>On Passions: From the Buddhist and Stoic Viewpoints</h1>

<p>Written by James Tan</p>

<hr />

<h2>What are Passions?</h2>

<p>Passions generally refer to the uncontrollably strong emotions that we
all feel from time to time.  Buddhism and Stoicism both perscribe the
limiting of these passions, but exactly how the two philosophies/religions
defines these passions and the manner in which they must be limited
varies greatly.</p>

<h2>Stoic view of passions</h2>

<h3>Definition of passions</h3>

<p>The Stoics defined the passions as &ldquo;movements of the soul,&rdquo; which in
the Stoic conception of physics was thought to be a physical, invisible
part of every human being.  These passions were divided into four main
categories: pleasure, distress, appetite, and fear.  The two internal
passions, pleasure and distress, stem from your internal state of either
happiness or distress.  The two external passions, appetite and fear,
stem from your reaction to external things, such as a craving or aversion
to some material object.</p>

<h3>The method of eliminating passions</h3>

<p>The Stoics had a concept called <em>eupathos</em>.  This term represented the
emotion&rsquo;s of a Stoic sage.  It described an emotional state that is
come upon with the backing of rational thought. The passions are all
irrational, e.g. pleasure is the irrational feeling of happiness without
justification. However the <em>eupathos</em> equivalent of pleasure is joy. Joy
is rationally justified, for example if one acted in a virtuous way, it
is rational to feel joy in this. However, you feel pleasure at having
money, because this is an irrational happiness since money is never
under one&rsquo;s direct control. To hypothesize, if the stock market were to
crash or something, all the value of your money woud disappear. However
one can always ensure that one acts virtuously.  Thus, rather than the
complete elimination of all emotions, Stoics suggested that all irrational
passions should be replaced with <em>eupathos</em>.</p>
