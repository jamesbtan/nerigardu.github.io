# On Passions: From the Buddhist and Stoic Viewpoints

Written by James Tan

## What are Passions?

Passions generally refer to the uncontrollably strong emotions that we
all feel from time to time.  Buddhism and Stoicism both perscribe the
limiting of these passions, but exactly how the two philosophies/religions
define these passions and the manner in which they must be limited
varies greatly.

## Stoic view of passions

### Stoic definition of passions

The Stoics defined the passions as 'movements of the soul' which in
the Stoic conception of physics was thought to be a physical, invisible
part of every human being.  These passions were divided into four main
categories: pleasure, distress, appetite, and fear.  The two internal
passions, pleasure and distress, stem from your internal state of either
happiness or distress.  The two external passions, appetite and fear,
stem from your reaction to external things, such as a craving or aversion
to some material object.

### The method of eliminating passions

The Stoics had a concept called *eupathos*.  This term represented the
emotion's of a Stoic sage.  It described an emotional state that is
come upon with the backing of rational thought. The passions are all
irrational, e.g. pleasure is the irrational feeling of happiness without
justification. However the *eupathos* equivalent of pleasure is joy. Joy
is rationally justified, for example if one acted in a virtuous way, it
is rational to feel joy in this. However, you feel pleasure at having
money, because this is an irrational happiness since money is never
under one's direct control. To hypothesize, if the stock market were to
crash or something, all the value of your money woud disappear. However
one can always ensure that one acts virtuously.  Thus, rather than the
complete elimination of all emotions, Stoics suggested that all irrational
passions should be replaced with *eupathos*.

### The state reached when passions are eliminated

The Stoics sought to reach a state known as *eudaimonia*. This
state occurs when one has completely replaced all emotions with its
corresponding part in *eupathos*.  The Stoics posited that this would
be achieved in realizing the irrational fallacies that often brought
suffering to people.  For example, it is an irrational fallacy to mourn
the loss of money or health, because you had no direct control over these
in the first place.  On the other hand, it is within one's control to act
with virtue and take control of what they are able. In fact, in Marcus
Aurelius' *Meditations*, he describes how attempting to control that
which you cannot control and not taking command of what you are able are
equally bad offenses. In thinking rationally as described here, the Stoics
believed it would be possible to life a life free from all suffering.

## Buddhist view of passions

### Buddhist definition of passions

The Buddhists divided the passions into three main categories: aversion,
desire, and ignorance. These passions, along with everything else
in the material world, bring suffering and are constantly changing,
according to the Three Marks of Existence: *dukkha* (suffering), *anicca*
(impermanence), and *anatta* (non-self).

### The method of eliminating passions

The Buddha proposed that all Buddhists follow the eight-fold path to learn
the absurdity of passions. The aforementioned concepts of non-self and
impermanence meant that any passions one felt now, no matter how real
they felt, were just illusions, as they would soon change into another
passion. Knowing that none of these passions are real, a Buddhist will
come to become less and less detached to their passions and at the
complete detachment, they become ready for Nirvana, as I expand in the
next section.

### The state reached when passions are eliminated

Upon the successful elimination of passions, the Buddhist becomes
ready for Nirvana at their death. However, a core Buddhist belief is
that suffering is a fundamental part of life, unlike Stoicism where
it was thought of as a mental state caused by irrational reasoning.
The term *dukkha*, which is usually translated as suffering, however
encompasses more than the Stoic conception of suffering.  It includes
things such as the daily annoyances of life and slight inconveniences
for example. The Buddhist believes that such things can never be gotten
rid of and will always prevent the perfect state of mind that can only
be achieved in Nirvana after death. However, the Stoics believed that
after internalizing rational thought, a Stoic would be able to recognize
that such things are out of one's control and thus shouldn't be worried
about and therefore won't be recognized as things that cause suffering.
