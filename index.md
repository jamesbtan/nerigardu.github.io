# On Passions: From the Buddhist and Stoic Viewpoints

Written by James Tan

---

## What are Passions?

Passions generally refer to the uncontrollably strong emotions that we
all feel from time to time.  Buddhism and Stoicism both perscribe the
limiting of these passions, but exactly how the two philosophies/religions
defines these passions and the manner in which they must be limited
varies greatly.

## Stoic view of passions

### Definition of passions

The Stoics defined the passions as 'movements of the soul' which in
the Stoic conception of physics was thought to be a physical, invisible
part of every human being.  These passions were divided into four main
categories: pleasure, distress, appetite, and fear.  The two internal
passions, pleasure and distress, stem from your internal state of either
happiness or distress.  The two external passions, appetite and fear,
stem from your reaction to external things, such as a craving or aversion
to some material object.

### The method of eliminating passions

The Stoics had a concept called *eupathos*.  This term represented the
emotion's of a Stoic sage.  It described an emotional state that is
come upon with the backing of rational thought. The passions are all
irrational, e.g. pleasure is the irrational feeling of happiness without
justification. However the *eupathos* equivalent of pleasure is joy. Joy
is rationally justified, for example if one acted in a virtuous way, it
is rational to feel joy in this. However, you feel pleasure at having
money, because this is an irrational happiness since money is never
under one's direct control. To hypothesize, if the stock market were to
crash or something, all the value of your money woud disappear. However
one can always ensure that one acts virtuously.  Thus, rather than the
complete elimination of all emotions, Stoics suggested that all irrational
passions should be replaced with *eupathos*.

### The state reached when passions are eliminated

The Stoics sought to reach a state known as *eudaimonia*. This
state occurs when one has completely replaced all emotions with its
corresponding part in *eupathos*.
The Stoics posited that this would be achieved in realizing the irrational fallacies that often brought suffering to people.
For example, it is an irrational fallacy to mourn the loss of money or health, because you had no direct control over these in the first place.
On the other hand, it is within one's control to act with virtue and take control of what they are able. In fact, in Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*, he describes how attempting to control that which you cannot control and not taking command of what you are able are equally bad offenses.
